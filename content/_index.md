{{< title >}}Ubiquitous Augmented Fashion: A Design Fiction on the Future of Digital Fashion in the Augmented Reality Metaverse

> {{< textstyle half-opaque >}}University of Technology Eindhoven - {{< /textstyle >}} Current developments in the area of augmented reality, computer vision and digital fashion allow us to fantasize about a future where we will be able to digitally augment the way we dress and present ourselves to our environment. 

In our study, we use design fiction to explore the social implications of integrating this technology in our daily lives. We started off by defining a future scenario by extrapolating from current trends. In this scenario, AR glasses have become ubiquitous and a working AR metaverse has been realized. We used this narrative as a basis for autoethnographic exploration, in which we experienced what it was like to design and wear augmented fashion. 

Our experiences from this exploration allowed us to refine our future scenario and construct multiple possible futures, with the designed outfits functioning as diegetic prototypes. Additionally, we created visual effect shots to further materialize the imagined futures. 

With a clear narrative in place, we organized multiple discussion sessions with people with various levels of knowledge on the topic. We are currently hard at work processing and analyzing our data and are excited about sharing our results soon.
